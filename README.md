=============

## No, this is not another client.

JNA: https://github.com/twall/jna

gtorrent-c: https://github.com/prince781/gtorrent

Most of this is autogenerated by JNAerator.

## How to run it (for fun)

Compile gtorrent-c into a shared library (.so file) and put it in /lib. Or download from here: https://mega.co.nz/#!bRkhiKwD!b4VImAfsJLICDBsCmGzkcaneK0IxwrqGydrjSJenUoo

Now try to compile & run.
